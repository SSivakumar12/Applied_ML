# Applied_ML
This work includes my report as well as the code as well.

Also included is a text file of certain packages that you may need and to ensure you have the necessary packages installed. 

If you do not have some of the packages:
1. Run <code> pip install -r requirements.txt </code>
2. Afterwards verify whether those packages are there by running <code>pip freeze</code> and seeing whether those packages are present in your enviroment
